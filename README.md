# hello-world
This is my first Repository
I have a dream to win $1,000 from Africa Innovation Contest
i have taken time to gather materials that will assist in my generation of Ideas
I plan to collaborate with two importantant personalities
After working on My own Draft, 
Eunice Obidi will help in finetuning the arrangement of my Ideas and First Level Proof Reading
Anani Sunday will help with the Final level proof reading
I will do the final overview before submission
Then I'll leave it in God's hands to bless my little efforts
